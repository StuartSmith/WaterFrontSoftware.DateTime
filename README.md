# WaterFrontSoftware.DateTime
This is a .net standard library used for setting and retrieving the Datetime used in C#. It gives a level of abstraction from the Datetime function given in C#, so it is possible to change the datetime used by an application without actually changing the datetime of the server that is running the code.
